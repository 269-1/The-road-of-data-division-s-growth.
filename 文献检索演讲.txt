Hello, I'm Liu Shuai from big data class 1. The theme of my speech is big data.
It `s  mainly divided into the following five parts - introduction, data sources, Characteristics, tools and problem. 
The first part is a brief introduction to big data .Big data is too big to be intercepted, managed, processed and sorted into information that can be interpreted by human beings in a reasonable time through existing means.
Then, the second part is the data source, which is mainly divided into the following three parts.It includes Business data,Internet of things data,Internet data.
Next, I want to talk about the characteristics of big data. 
The first feature is Moore's law of big data, which roughly says that the amount of data will increase by fifty precent every two years. 
The second is the large amount of data. Some experts once predicted that the amount of data will reach thirty-five zb by two thousand and twenty. 
The third point is the diversity of data types, which may be scientific research data, data in practical application or data in the network.
Then, this is a comparison with traditional data types. The data is mainly based on traditional data types. 
The fourth point is high speed, which has a 1second theorem. It means     It takes only 1 second from data generation to decision response.
The last feature is low value, that is, the proportion of useful data is relatively small. 
The fourth part is tools. Our common tools are Hadoop, spark, hive, etc. 
the first is Hadoop, and its schematic diagram is on the right, the second spark, and then hive. 
The last part is a question, what is big data used for? 
Thank you for your listenning.
